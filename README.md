# `react-scroll` Tutorial
I built this project as a complement to an **[article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-silky-smooth-scroll-in-react-5dj3xdl)** I wrote about using react-scroll to add smooth scrolling to your projects.

**NPM packages used on this project:**

- [`react-scroll`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)
- [`styled-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)
